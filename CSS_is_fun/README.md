CSS is a lot of fun

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, Scrimba has created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and theye're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay their bills, they have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
	one of their paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.  

Happy Coding!
