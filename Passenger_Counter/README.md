A friend had a task of counting cars that passed by the road. I coded this simple app that allows them to count cars at the tap of a button. It is built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It can be customised to a counter of your choice.


I came across this idea at Scrimba. Check them out!


## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, Scrimba have created over 20 free courses, and they are going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay their bills, they have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
	one of their paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to them if you share the courses.  

Happy Coding!g!
